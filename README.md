# Robust-Quadcopter

## Aim 
To create a dynamically controllable model of a QuadCopter using MATLAB-SIMULINK

## Description
A QuadCopter is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle 4 rotors control whose motion. In 3D-space it has 6 degrees-of-freedom viz. 3 translatory (along x, y, z axes) and 3 Rotational (about x, y, z axes). Here two controllers: PID and LQR applied models gave results and compared their error plots.
